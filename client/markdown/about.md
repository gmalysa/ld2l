## About LD2L
This is a league for players below 4K MMR to play Dota in a competitive-style setting without pressure from 5k+ players as may be common in RD2L or other leagues. The goal is to learn about playing Dota in general and about playing in a competitive team-based setting. External coaching, review, and education based on the games is encouraged but not guaranteed.

The league is based in North America on the US East server. But we have consistently had players from EU, SA, as well as CIS whose ping permitted them to play comfortably on US East.
